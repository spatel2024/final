            <h2>Hundred Duel Salmon</h2>
            <p>$20</p>
            <p>Andrew Jackson was famous for surviving approximately one hundred duels. 
                However, Jackson had sustained shot wounds from these duels. In a duel against Charles Dickenson over insults of Jackson’s wife’s, 
                Jackson was shot as his gun jammed. Despite this, he survived and killed Dickenson with his next shot. This aspect of Jackson’s life is represented by the smoked salmon 
                as he succeeded in smoking hundreds in his duels.

            <h2>Orphans in a Blanket</h2>
            <p>$15</p>
            <p>During the American Revolutionary War, much of Andrew Jackson’s family was killed. Finally, at the age of 14, Jackson’s mom died of cholera while serving as a nurse in the United States military. This recipe represents orphans in blankets, symbolizing the tough and isolating childhood of Andrew Jackson. Despite this tough childhood, Andrew Jackson pursued education in law and eventually became the president of the United States.

            <h2>Patriotic Hard Boiled Eggs</h2>
            <p>$5</p>
            <p>At the young age of 13, Andrew Jackson voluntarily enlisted in the military to fight for the United States’ independence against the British. His tragic experience in the war and loss of loved ones grew his hatred towards the British. These hard boiled eggs represent Andrew Jackson’s extraordinarily hard life growing up.
