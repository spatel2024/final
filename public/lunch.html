            <h2>Peggy Rigatoni with Shrimp</h2>
            <p>$20</p>
            <p> Since Andrew Jackson’s wife was abused by the press when he first took office, he despised such public abuse in any context. Later, Peggy Eaton, wife of the Secretary of War, was similarly abused and excluded by others. Andrew Jackson defended Peggy Eaton and forced others to include her socially. This reaction became the “Eaton Affair”. This meal, consisting of two very different main ingredients, shows how it is important to work in unison despite a lack of common ground, referencing the Eaton Affair and how excluding anyone like they excluded Peggy Eaton is not beneficial.

            <h2>Pasta Oleander Waldorf (POW) Salad</h2>
            <p>$18</p>
            <p> Andrew Jackson suffered a wildly difficult childhood. Having enlisted in the United States army at thirteen years old, he and his brother was caught by the British not long after. Jackson’s reluctance to follow commands as a prisoner of the British resulted in him being tortured. When he was finally freed, he retained scars from when he was hit with a sword. The primary ingredients to this meal spell out the acronym: POW, referencing Andrew Jackson’s time as such a prisoner.
