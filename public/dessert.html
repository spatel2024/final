            <p>$8</p>
            <p>Andrew Jackson lead the Indians on the Trail of Tears through his Indian Removal Act. Although this is not a sweet event at all,
               this was beneficial for the president. He was able to secure Georgia for himself so that he could obtain the gold discovered in that location.
               There are little tear drops on the chocolate cake to represent the Indians' tears and sadness for being displaced from their homes. 46,000 
               natives were removed from their 25,000,000 acre plots. While a person eats through the glorious, moist cake, they will be 
               reminded of the harsh event that Jackson caused. The truffle cake includes a chocolate ganache as flavors of cocoa and cinnamon ooze in customers' mouths.

            <h2>Golden Raspberry Chocolate Torte</h2>
            <p>$12</p>
            <p>This sweet is the perfect way to end a lovely breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It remains golden, the best dessert in the area. As one takes a bite into the golden
               delight, they will think of the feeling Andrew Jackson felt when he discovered that there was gold in Georgia. After the Indian Removal Act, the land with the gold
               was auctioned off to locals. This helped influence more settlers to locate in Georgia. Additionally, people grew greedy and wanted these lands. As a result, this led
               to one of the first gold rushes.
