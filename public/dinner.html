            <h2>Not Quite Texas-Annexed Steak</h2>
            <p>$35</p>
            <p>While Andrew Jackson was in favor of annexing Texas, he did not carry out the plan during his presidency. The Texas territory had gained independence from Mexico in 1836 and desired to join the US. Additionally, annexing the territory would aid the idea of Manifest Destiny for the United States, expanding the country towards the west coast. However, the addition of this state would offset the balance of slave and free states, causing hesitation about adding the state until 1845. This Texas Steak from a cow references Texasâ€™ famous culture of cowboys and ranching.

            <h2>Lamb Chops ended by a BUS</h2>
            <p>$40</p>
            <p> Andrew Jackson strongly opposed the Bank of the United States during his time in office. He believed that the BUS kept wealth and power in the hands of a small group of people and encouraged monopolies. Andrew Jackson believed that the removal of the BUS would advantage the common men of the United States. Jackson vetoed the recharter of the BUS during his presidency, causing it to end in 1836. As the lamb, a herd animal, represents the common man. This meal, lamb killed by a BUS, symbolized how the Bank of the United States killed opportunity for the common man in the United States in the eyes of Andrew Jackson.
